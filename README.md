## Project Overview
The essence of this project is to show insights that can be drawn from a sales dataset to help address business concerns. In this project, I analyzed the sales data of a bicycle store using Microsoft Excel. 
Let’s call the store **Imaginary Inc.
The data set analyzed contains 113,037 rows of transactions carried out over 6-years across six countries.
#### Business Concerns:
The management of Imaginary Inc would like to allocate resources to support marketing efforts and improve revenue properly. They must understand their target demographic and tailor their marketing campaign and product offering accordingly.
They would also like to make informed data-driven decisions about what to stock, what to discontinue, inventory allocation, what to discount, product design, and the introduction of premium models.
The goal is to enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, pricing, and customer engagement, ultimately leading to improved business outcomes and growth.

## Project Objective:
At the core of this project are the business concerns articulated by the management of Imaginary Inc. This project focuses on creating informative reports to help Imaginary Inc’s stakeholders to make well-informed business decisions that address the concerns raised. 

1.	The year-over-year assessment of the comprehensive sales performance is intended to support stakeholders in evaluating the historical business growth trajectory spanning the last six years. Armed with this data, stakeholders can delve deeper, considering market dynamics and economic factors, to extract additional insights conducive to the pursuit of overarching growth objectives.

2.	Analysis of sales performance across different regions aims to aid stakeholders in discerning high-performing areas and those requiring heightened focus. This information empowers them to make resource allocation decisions, refine marketing strategies, and strategically target regions to foster growth.

3.	Product sales analysis aims to scrutinize the performance of diverse products. This enables stakeholders to pinpoint the most favoured items and adapt their inventory management and marketing endeavours correspondingly. Moreover, they can strategically determine actions such as product promotions, discounts, or the discontinuation of underperforming products.

4.	The analysis of age groups, which categorizes sales according to different age segments, facilitates comprehension of the intended demographic. This, in turn, allows for the customization of marketing initiatives and product assortments tailored to distinct age brackets. Such insights guide decisions concerning product design and strategies for engaging with customers.

5.	The Price Point Analysis entails an assessment of sales in relation to varying price categories. By gaining an understanding of the price ranges that yield the highest sales and revenue, stakeholders are empowered to formulate determinations concerning pricing strategies, including the potential introduction of premium models.

## Key Steps

#### Data Sourcing:
The data utilized was downloaded from Kaggle to my local computer in .csv file format for the purpose of this project.

#### Data Cleaning:
The dataset was accessed within an Excel workbook titled "Bicycle Dataset". The sheet housing this dataset has been labelled as "Source_Data".
A replication of the original dataset has been generated on a separate worksheet within the same "Bicycle Dataset" workbook. This duplication was accomplished by selecting the entire dataset (Ctrl + Shift + Right arrow, followed by Down arrow), copying it (Ctrl + C), and subsequently pasting it (Ctrl + V) into the new worksheet.
This new worksheet is designated as "Bicycle_Sales". The forthcoming steps in the project involve the cleansing and manipulation of data on the "Bicycle_Sales" worksheet.
